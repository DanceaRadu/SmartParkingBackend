## Smart Parking

The backend for a Smart parking application, implmented using Spring, with Kotlin. This app was done for the Embedded Systems lab. 
The parking app works in the following way: A user must create an account, after which he can choose to add a subscription for a car (based on the licence plate). The subscription is created using **Stripe**. Once the payment is successful and until the subscription expires, the added car has access to the parking lot.
